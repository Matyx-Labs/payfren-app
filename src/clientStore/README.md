# Client Store details

- The client store is a simple key-value store that is used to store and share state globally across the application.
- Built on top of [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)
- Should be used for storing data that is not persisted to the server, but is needed across the application.
